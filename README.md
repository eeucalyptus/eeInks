# eeInks

Although I just added the first plugin, I like the idea of generating parts in inkscape. That's why I am positive, that it is not going to stay that lonely for long.

Check out my blog for more information: [eeucalyptus.net](https://eeucalyptus.net)

## Installation

Place the extentions (each one `*.inx` and one `*.py`) either in the shared extention directory or in the user extention directory. 

You can also get the packed versions from the inkscape gallery if I packed them: (https://inkscape.org/gallery/=extension/)
