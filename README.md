# eeInks

Although I just added the first plugin, I like the idea of generating parts in inkscape. That's why I am positive, that it is not going to stay that lonely for long.

## Installation

Place the extentions (each one `*.inx` and one `*.py`) either in the shared extention directory or in the user extention directory. 

You can also get the packed versions from the inkscape gallery if I packed them.
